                <p style="line-height: 40px; text-align: justify;">It all starts with a vision and desire, as the passion always comes later. I grew up and spent most of my teenage years at a boarding school where i learnt arabic and how to write it. I was always good at art as well, and found great interest in art, particularly graffiti. It was at the age of 16 where i combined my graffiti skills with arabic graffiti and created the name caligraffiti. What really made me chase my dream wasn't the fact i was good at what i did or that i loved art, it was the media who misrepresented my faith and it's values. Because of this, I knew i had to portray a different message to the public through art, not words. <a href="about.html" style="color: aqua;">Continue...</a></p></section>

                <h1 style="text-align: center;" id="Graphicdesignexperience">Graphic Design Experience</h1>

                <p style="line-height: 40px; text-align: justify;">I have been a graphic designer for 8 years, in my years of experience i have designed logos in English and Arabic. Utilising my digital skills, drawing skills and typography skills in logo design, i decided to move on to branding design. Thereafter, this tied me into webdesign, designing using front end tools, i learnt HTML & CSS. My Graphic Design skills include Adobe Ps, Illustartor, XD, InDesign and as of recent, Dimension. I have created branding for clients globally and have designed clothing as well. As of now i design Creative Conceptions, being the head of social media content and also marketing/branding lead. Ensuring that all brands we have are correctly marketed and branded online on all platforms, particularly Amazon and our own website as well as on social media. I have designed for a range of companies in different industries, such as construction, house repairs, roofers, landscapers, restaurants, hotels and many more. Furthermore, i have designed for the adult novelty gifts and also sexual health industries.</p>
